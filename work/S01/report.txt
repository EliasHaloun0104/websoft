Assignment A01
My very first course was on Khand Academy platform and it was about on of the JavaScript library which use on HTML canvas for drawing. The purpose of the course was to learn programming and not related directory to the web development and my few next courses were taken before starting in Kristianstad Högskola were Web Utveckling & Web Server Programmering for the Swedish secondary school level.
I learn a little about Html, CSS, JavaScript, php and SQL and as one of the assignments for those courses I had to build a website both static and dynamic and learn how to send and receive data from and to database using PHP. Since I start my study in Kristianstad Högskola I became far from the web development domain since all our previous courses isn't related directly to the web development.
This course is a great opportunity to restore and add new to my previous information since I never worked with any framework. Specifically, for this section I will try to figure out the whole picture and decide which skills I have to mastered, but in general my interesting is on the backend part.
I learnt to use Git & GitHub but since I'm a person who prefer to deal with GUI, I rarely worked with command line. My knowledge in Git & GitHub doesn't go deep, I assume that I understand and implement the basics push, pull, commit but still have to make some effort and read document behind those, So the Markdown and GitHub pages are new concepts to me.
