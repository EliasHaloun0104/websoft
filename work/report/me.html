<p>My name is Elias Haloun, I came to Sweden five years ago and I live in MÃ¶rrum / Karlshamn municipality. I have been in Kuwait, Syria, Lebanon & UAE</p>

<p>I got my bachelar degree in economy back in 2004 and a have ten years experience in accounting, but some time in 2015 I realized that my passion is not in the financial domain so I decided to move to programming. Where I was always interested.</p>

<p>I enjoy watching movie, playing chess & programming, I like to solve problems, so when you ask me to solve a problem I open my computer start Unity Project and start visualizated it in order to be able to solve it later.</p>
